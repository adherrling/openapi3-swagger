**items** | [**list[ComponentsschemasDestinyDefinitionsMilestonesDestinyMilestoneQuestRewardItem]**](ComponentsschemasDestinyDefinitionsMilestonesDestinyMilestoneQuestRewardItem.md) | The items that represent your reward for completing the quest.  Be warned, these could be \&quot;dummy\&quot; items: items that are only used torender a good-looking in-game tooltip, but aren&#39;t the actual items themselves.  For instance, when experience is given there&#39;s often a dummy item representing \&quot;experience\&quot;,with quantity being the amount of experience you got.  We don&#39;t have a programmatic associationbetween those and whatever Progression is actually getting that experience... yet. | [optional]
