**modifier_hashes** | **list[int]** | If the activity has modifiers, this will be the list of modifiers that all variantshave in common.  Perform lookups againstDestinyActivityModifierDefinition which defines the modifier being applied to getat the modifier data.Note that, in the DestiyActivityDefinition, you will see many more modifiers than thisbeing referred to: those are all *possible* modifiers for the activity, not the active ones.Use only the active ones to match what&#39;s really live. | [optional] 
**variants** | [**list[ComponentsschemasDestinyMilestonesDestinyMilestoneActivityVariant]**](ComponentsschemasDestinyMilestonesDestinyMilestoneActivityVariant.md) | If you want more than just name/location/etc... you&#39;re going to have to dig intoand show the variants of the conceptual activity.
